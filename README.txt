Only works if you have the language set to english in your EA-Launcher.
You need to have the latest Python version installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
This README.txt file also acts as the settings for the EaAutoSignOn.pyw. Both files need to be in the same folder.
The e-mail/username HAS to be in the very first line of this text file, the password HAS to be in the second, and the delay HAS to be in the third line.

If the credentials aren't filled in correctly, or if you have a slower system,
increase the delay to give the launcher some time to load (default = 2 seconds).

The following libaries are required:
pyautogui
keyboard
Pillow
pywin32
pyscreeze

If you want to be lazy, you can put this script in your startup-folder (win+r -> shell:startup)
